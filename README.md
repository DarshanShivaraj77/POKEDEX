# POKEDEX

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.


The Pokedex Flutter Project involves creating a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter that serves as a comprehensive Pokédex. This app allows users to browse through detailed information on all Pokémon, including their types, abilities, stats, and evolutions. The project leverages Flutter's robust UI toolkit to design an intuitive and visually appealing interface, while also integrating API calls to fetch and display real-time data about each Pokémon. With features like search functionality, filtering, and bookmarking favorite Pokémon, this project showcases the power of Flutter in developing a dynamic and user-friendly application that functions smoothly across both Android and iOS platforms.
